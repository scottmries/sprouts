Mobile implementation of [Conway's Sprouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_(game)).

TODO:

Create dot and line types.

Dots have: 
- coordinates 
- number of lines connected (color-coded)

Lines have:
- sequential points between which they're constructed
- dots on them

Not that putting a dot on a line makes it two lines

Lines and dots can both be drawn

The canvas can be panned and zoomed around

Once lines and dots can be drawn, implement game rules, including permissible lines, player alteration, and end state
